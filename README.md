# alu-AirBnB_clone

## Description

This is a clone of the AirBnB web application developed as part of the ALU software engineering curriculum.  
The project is aimed at building a simplified version of the AirBnB platform, with a focus on object modeling, file storage, and command interpretation in Python.  

It includes:
- A custom command-line interface (CLI) for managing object instances.
- A storage engine that saves and loads data to/from a JSON file.
- Implementation of core AirBnB objects: `BaseModel`, `User`, `Place`, `State`, `City`, `Amenity`, and `Review`.
